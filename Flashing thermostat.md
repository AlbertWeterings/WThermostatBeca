## Notice
Modifying and flashing of devices is at your own risk. I'm not responsible for bricked or damaged devices. I strongly recommend a backup of original firmware before installing any other software.

## Choose your way
There are 2 options to flash the firmware on device:
1. Unplug and open the device, wire 4 cables and connect it to a programmer for ESP8266 and flash
2. Use tuya-convert for flashing. Not tested from my side, tested and committed by another user

## Check Is my device
Compatible devices looks inside like this. On the right you can see the ESP8266 module (TYWE3S)
